>Abstract

Cars are almost a necessity in the current world. With cutthroat completion, it is imperative that a car be well priced for it to be successful in the market. This study analyzes the characteristics of cars with price in context and identifies major factors that constitute the price of a car. It also uses these identified factors to predict car prices. It makes use of the characteristic’s engine size, horsepower, drive train which can be measured easily before the vehicle goes on sale. It does an exhaustive comparison of regression techniques namely – Stepwise regression, Ridge regression, LASSO Regression and Elastic Net regression to predict car prices. The performance metric RMSE and R-squared vales are used to determine which model performs better. This study can be used has a guide for car manufactures to price their cars based on the car’s characteristics. This can in turn help them to position themselves better in the market and edge out competition.

>Introduction

Car prices are a crucial factor in determining the success of a car. Although the buying decision relies on a host of factors, price is the deciding factor most of the time. With the introduction of data science in business sectors, companies look towards techniques to improve their revenue using the data that is readily available to them. This is where this study comes into play. All the variables in the dataset are information that the company has before the car goes on sale. While controlling the other factors, manufactures can play with the price of the car and see how much margin they can afford for each unit sale.

The response variable “price” is predicted using various car characteristics like – aspiration, fuel-type, curb weight, engine type etc. Each regression technique performs a selection of variables that it deems fit for predicting the price of the car. We choose the best model based on the performance evaluation metric R-squared and RMSE. Typically, a high R-squared value and a low RMSE score is considered as the better model. This study will also help car manufactures to determine which characteristic of the car influences the car prices and can take managerial steps to maximise profit.
